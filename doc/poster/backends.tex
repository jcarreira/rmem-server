\begin{block}{Backends}
    Underneath the RVM layer is a remote memory backend, which handles
    communication with the remote node. The rmem layer implements basic
    functions like \texttt{malloc()}, \texttt{free()}, \texttt{put()},
    \texttt{get()}, and \texttt{commit()}. So far we have implemented two
    different backends. One uses a custom protocol based on Infiniband RDMA.
    The other uses RAMCloud, an Infiniband-based key-value store.
