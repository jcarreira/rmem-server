    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{DGEMV} - Multiply a matrix by a vector and repeat using
            the result. We run using a 100,000 x 100 matrix over 1000
            iterations.  We measure how the total runtime is affected by
            failure rate (the number iterations between restarts) and commit
            rate (number of iterations between commits) and compare the
            results to simply saving the data to a file.
        \item \textbf{Gene Assembly} - Assemble gene sequences from a set of
            k-mers (fixed size gene sequences). We measure how the total
            runtime is affected by commit rate and compare the results to
            process state checkpointing using BLCR.
