\begin{block}{RVM API}
    RVM allows the user to allocate recoverable regions of memory and
    atomically replicate changes to that memory to a remote nodeâ€™s DRAM. The
    user simply identifies recovery points in their code through a
    transactional API.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \verb|rvm_cfg_create()| - Initialize the system and recover
            memory if needed.
        \item \verb|rvm_alloc()| - Allocate a region of recoverable memory.
        \item \verb|rvm_free()| - Free a region of recoverable memory.
        \item \verb|rvm_txn_start()| - Mark the beginning of a transaction.
        \item \verb|rvm_txn_commit()| - Atomically commit any changes made
            to recoverable memory since the last call to \verb|rvm_txn_start()|.
    \end{itemize}
\end{block}
