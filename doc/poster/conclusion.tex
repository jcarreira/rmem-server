\begin{block}{Conclusion}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Nephele provides checkpoints with microsecond latencies over
            complex in-memory data structures.
        \item The changes required to accommodate rvm were minimal,
            especially when compared to manual serialization.
        \item However, commit latency and recovery time increase considerably
            when a large number of pages are used.
        \item Still have a ways to go in improving performance.
    \end{itemize}
