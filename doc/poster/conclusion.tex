\begin{block}{Conclusion}
    Our library is able to provide checkpoints with microsecond latencies over
    complex in-memory data structures. In the case of DGEMV, natural runtime
    variation completely masked the effect of frequent checkpointing. The
    changes required to accommodate rvm were minimal, especially when compared
    to manual serialization. In the case of the genome benchmark, we were
    able to checkpoint a complicated data structure with lots of pointer with
    minimal effort. However, with such a large number of pages being changed,
    commit latency increased considerably. We still have a ways to go in
    improving performance.
