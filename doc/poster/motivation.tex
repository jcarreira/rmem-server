\begin{block}{Motivation}
    As the number of nodes in distributed systems increases, failures become
    the rule, not the exception. Because of this, it is important to be able to
    recover from crashes quickly and with minimal impact on performance and
    complexity. Checkpointing and manual serialization/deserialization are both
    slow and complicated.
