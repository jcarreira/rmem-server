    \begin{itemize}
        \item In the micro-benchmarks, we measure how long it takes to commit
            changes to a set of pages and how long it takes to recover a set
            of pages after a crash.
        \item Took measurements for both backends and compared with BLCR.
        \item Commit latency increases linearly with number of pages.
        \item Recovery latency also increases, but not as neatly.
    \end{itemize}
