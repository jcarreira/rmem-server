In this paper, we presented Recoverable Virtual Memory, our solution for easy
replication and recovery of application state. We have attempted to provide
our implementation with features we believe are highly desirable for the
application programmer, such as a simple and understandable API; restoration
of virtual address locations, which allows for recovery of complex data
structures without the need for serialization; and reasonably low overhead.
Of these three goals, we have accomplished the first two, but there is still
considerable work to be done in regards to performance.

The primary optimization we could make is to coalesce RDMA operations for
contiguous pages. In our current infiniband backend, allocation of the backing
memory for multiple contiguous pages must be done a page at a time.
However, it would be much more efficient to perform a single contiguous
allocation on the server side. That way, the number of RDMA write calls and
TXN\_MULTI\_CP messages does not need to increase as
