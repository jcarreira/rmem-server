The RVM library consists of two main layers on the client side. An upper layer
to implement the RVM-specific logic and a lower-layer remote memory (RMEM)
backend to implement low-level transport and atomicity. This relationship is
described in figure \ref{lasagna}. This modularization allows for a number of
different backends to be tried independently of user code and the RVM layer.
This enhances portability and simplifies future efforts to improve performance
or semantics.
