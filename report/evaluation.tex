We characterized the performance of our RVM backend implementations by writing
several benchmark applications and running them on our Firebox-0 cluster.
Firebox-0 is a research cluster built by Berkeley's ASPIRE lab and consists
of high-end commercial off-the-shelf server connected by Mellanox Infiniband
switches.
